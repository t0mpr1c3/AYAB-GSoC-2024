<!-- l. 21 --><p class='noindent'><a href='https://ayab-knitting.com/'>AYAB</a> (All Yarns Are Beautiful) is an open-source software and electronics project to
retrofit vintage Brother knitting machines to be controlled by computer. This
enables users to design and knit garments using a low-cost home knitting
machine.
</p><!-- l. 23 --><p class='noindent'>
</p>
<h4 class='subsectionHead' id='product'><span class='titlemark'>1.2   </span> <a id='x1-30001.2'></a>Product</h4>
<!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>AYAB distributes a desktop application that enables the user to knit a multicolor
fabric design from an image. (See Figure 1.) The software governs an Arduino-based
controller that interfaces with Brother 900-series electronic knitting machines. AYAB
also publishes the firmware and hardware specifications for the controller.
The hardware is registered with <a href='https://certification.oshwa.org/us002598.html'>OSHWA</a>. The source code is curated in a

<h4 class='subsectionHead' id='impact'><span class='titlemark'>1.3   </span> <a id='x1-40001.3'></a>Impact</h4>
<!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'>The project was conceived by Christian Obersteiner and Andreas Müller in 2013 and
has since gained contributors from Belgium, Germany, Poland, Sweden, the UK, and
the USA. There are are active users in at least 15 countries from Europe, Asia, the
Americas, and Oceania. The Facebook and Discord groups number 1,552 and 70
members respectively, and there are 402 group members on the fiber craft social
media platform Ravelry.
</p><!-- l. 31 --><p class='noindent'>AYAB workshops are conducted as part of the annual <a href='http://etextilespringbreak.org/'>eTextile Spring Break</a>, and the
technology has been featured in numerous media, including MAKE Magazine and the
forthcoming documentary film, <a href='https://www.thedomesticmachine.com/'><span class='cmti-10'>The Domestic Machine</span>.</a>

<h4 class='subsectionHead' id='prototype-ui-for-ayab-web-app'><span class='titlemark'>2.1   </span> <a id='x1-60002.1'></a>Prototype UI for AYAB web app</h4>
<!-- l. 47 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Goal. </span>Redesign the user interface and prototype a new client.
</p><!-- l. 49 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Description. </span>Currently the AYAB desktop app, written in PyQt5, is hard to
maintain across different operating systems and cannot be operated from
mobile platforms. AYAB has committed to re-implementing the UI as a web
application.
</p><!-- l. 51 --><p class='noindent'>The initial web app prototype will be a standalone client that communicates
with the AYAB interface over USB. The web app will consist of modular
webcomponents that can be assembled to recreate the existing PyQT UI.
When the next version of the AYAB hardware is ready, it will host the web
frontend on an ESP32 microcontroller embedded in the AYAB interface
itself.
</p><!-- l. 53 --><p class='noindent'>The precise scope of the work will be negotiated with the student, taking into
account their availability and skill set.
</p><!-- l. 55 --><p class='noindent'>The goals of this project are central to the future of AYAB. The skills learned as part
of this project have wide application.
</p><!-- l. 57 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Skills required. </span>Some knowledge of Python and basic familiarity with
HTML/JavaScript. Previous experience with TypeScript and <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components'>web components</a> is
preferred.
</p><!-- l. 59 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Duration. </span>175-350 hours.
</p><!-- l. 61 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Mentors. </span>Carson, Tom.

<h4 class='subsectionHead' id='develop-ayab-website'><span class='titlemark'>2.2   </span> <a id='x1-70002.2'></a>Develop AYAB website</h4>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!-- l. 66 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Goal. </span>Design and build a website with wiki or social media features that facilitates
documentation of the AYAB project by its end users.
</p><!-- l. 68 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Description. </span>AYAB has committed to overhauling its website, Not only has the online
documentation not kept pace with developments in the software, but its
compliance with accessibility and W3C standards is unknown. Moreover,
user-generated content is lacking. There is, for example, a good deal of relevant
video in the public domain that could be incorporated into the educational
materials.
</p><!-- l. 70 --><p class='noindent'>Improved documentation will help existing AYAB users to make best use of the
project and foster outreach to new users. Allowing users to contribute to the
documentation will also provide a useful gateway to draw contributors into AYAB
as an open-source ecosystem, helping to widen its outlook and ensure its
future.
</p><!-- l. 72 --><p class='noindent'>In its present form, the documentation can only be edited in a Github repository.
This presents a high barrier to participation for many AYAB users. A website with
wiki or blogging features will allow less technically-minded knitters to contribute to
the ecosystem.
</p><!-- l. 74 --><p class='noindent'>AYAB is a project with users all over the world, and outreach on social media has
shown that efforts to accommodate non-English speakers may be particularly
valuable.
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Skills required. </span>The contributor will be mentored in the use of HTML, CSS,
Javascript, Git, and other tools as needed. Prior experience is not necessary.
</p><!-- l. 78 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Duration. </span>90-175 hours.

<h4 class='subsectionHead' id='extend-ayab-stitch-options'><span class='titlemark'>2.3   </span> <a id='x1-80002.3'></a>Extend AYAB stitch options</h4>
<!-- l. 85 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Goal. </span>Reconfigure the internal representation of the AYAB software to allow different
stitch types, and change the graphical output to show stitch symbols in the pattern
image.
</p><!-- l. 87 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Description. </span>AYAB currently implements various different methods for colorwork
knitting, but does not allow variations in texture.
</p><!-- l. 89 --><p class='noindent'>Allowing different kinds of stitch – first and foremost Purl stitches, but possibly also
increases, decreases, and cables – would increase the range of designs that can be
                                                                  

                                                                  
created and enable AYAB users to make better use of the capabilities of their
knitting machines.
</p><!-- l. 91 --><p class='noindent'>A stretch goal is to extend the functionality of the UI to include stitch-by-stitch
editing of the pattern, a feature that has frequently been requested by users.
</p><!-- l. 93 --><p class='noindent'>This is an opportunity for a creative contributor to expand the project in new
directions.
</p><!-- l. 95 --><p class='noindent'><span class='cmti-10'>Skills required. </span>Python or Javascript are preferred.

<!-- l. 106 --><p class='noindent'>The student and mentor will communicate frequently to develop the project in an
efficient manner and maintain a structured software development approach.
Specifically:
</p><!-- l. 109 --><p class='noindent'>The student will send an email or chat message each morning answering the following
three questions: 1) What did you plan to do yesterday? What was the outcome? 2)
What are you planning to do today? 3) Is there anything that might prevent you
from achieving this goal? How can others help you?
</p><!-- l. 115 --><p class='noindent'>The code will be maintained in a Github repository. Short term goals will be tracked
using Github issues. The GSoC student will be expected to contribute regular
updates during the day.
</p><!-- l. 117 --><p class='noindent'>The student will schedule weekly Zoom meetings with their mentor. They may also
communicate <span class='cmti-10'>ad hoc</span>. The mentor will email the organisational admin on a weekly
basis to summarize recent developments.
