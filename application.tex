\section{Ideas List}

EVERY IDEA NEEDS A POTENTIAL MENTOR.

PLEASE NOMINATE YOURSELF IF YOU ARE INTERESTED.

\begin{itemize}
\item Core project (350 hours). Recoding the AYAB UI as a web app.

\section{GSoC Goals}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inspire developers to begin participating in open source development.
\item Help open source projects identify and bring in new developers.
\item Get more open source code written and released for the benefit of all.
\item Give newer developers more exposure to real-world software development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic Admin}

\begin{itemize}
\item Feb 6, 2024: Mentoring organization application deadline
\item AYAB qualifies as a mentoring organisation because it is an open source software project.
\item At least two contributors must serve as organization administrators and/or mentors throughout the entire duration of the program.
\item The mentoring organisation does not need to be a legal entity, although it will receive money from Google which will presumably need to go through a US bank account.
\item The main part of the program runs from the end of May until the beginning of September.
\end{itemize}
